# required

- prefill chat on click
- cooler dice rolls
- simple list format (single-row items, triple-dot on right of each item for delete/duplicate)
- action buttons
- visibility toggle (same former purpose-ish as share toggle)

# ideas

- list reordering (buttons)
- list reordering (DnD)
- silo characters in rooms (instead of sharing them across all rooms)
- text autocomplete options
- "grow" option for blocks in containers (?)
