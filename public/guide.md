Welcome to **Aspects of Nature, **a story-focused TTRPG, set in a contemporary setting, interspersed with supernatural elements and pockets of fantasy.

Enter Rosenfeld. The bustling city is one of few cities in Eisenwald with an urban, modern look and feel, despite, by our standards, having medieval-level technology. It manages this having weaved element-based technique and automation through various facets of daily life.

**Fire. Water. Wind. Light. Darkness.** Though the five **aspects** take a backseat to everyday life, they have enabled a breadth of capability, innovation, and exploration otherwise impossible.

**Aspect art** is less like magic in the sense of spells and incantations, and more like a martial art, working primarily through focus, intent, and alignment with the surrounding environment.

Rosenfeld in particular offers a diverse look at the various **lineages** of Eisenkind: the presentation of traits from specific creatures through otherwise human-like figures. You'll find humans with the ears and tails of canines, felines, rabbits, mice, bears, raccoons, and several other common land mammals. You'll find aquatic-based humans with fins, humans with horns and scales like that of dragons and lizards, those with the feathered wings of a bird, with the antennae and wings of insects, or even the horns and spaded tail characteristic of a devil. The several similar but distinct origins of Eisenkind are represented here in Rosenfeld.

Among these variant folk, you'll see some happily chatting with friends through the tall glass windows of a cafe, warmly lit by candle-like light aspect crystals. You'll see students running after one another, recklessly firing blasts of water and wind at one another‚Äîthe first one, a young fin-adorned aquatic, bumps into you, then he and his more timid demonic friend briefly apologize, before continuing with more care. You'll pass by a construction site, with several workers summon gusts of wind to propel themselves high into the frames of buildings to place the next few parts, welding them together with the heat of their fire aspect, while some slow their descent coming back down with practiced ease.

Your ears suddenly flick and stand tall as they pick up a noise from behind, but as you turn to look, no one is there. It sounded like a gasp‚Äîalmost like‚Ä¶ a squelched shout? ‚Ä¶Maybe you're hearing things.

# Story First

In **Aspects of Nature**, the narrative drives everything‚Äîmechanics serve the story, not the other way around. When players want to accomplish something, they describe their intended actions in detail, and the n**arrator** determines what [rolls](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e803d8566fb10e0b5130c#1b1b0b885c0e80e1a1afd501f2cb10d5) (if any) are needed based on the narrative context. For example, if a character wants to leap across a chasm while avoiding enemy fire, the Narrator might call for a [Maneuver](https://www.notion.so/1b2b0b885c0e80d8808fff1f3c9325e9) roll for the acrobatic movement.

Even mechanical effects like [damage and fatigue](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e803d8566fb10e0b5130c#1b1b0b885c0e8004afdedc7da3907471) should be woven into the story. Standing in a fire doesn't just mean "take X damage per round" - the Narrator describes how the flames affect the character, and may call for [Endure](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80d68ac8e515eec2363b) rolls to resist the heat, or [Focus](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80a38b8ac8e71457aa77) rolls to maintain concentration through the pain.

When using [aspect art](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e803d8566fb10e0b5130c#1b8b0b885c0e8080b28fc4202b7263fd), players are encouraged to be creative with their descriptions. Rather than simply saying "I attack with fire," a player might describe how they draw heat from nearby torches, condensing it into a spiraling flame that seeks out their target. The Narrator then interprets these narrative choices into mechanical effects.

This story-first approach means that, while the game has clear rules and mechanics, they exist to _enhance_ the narrative experience rather than restrict it. The goal is to create compelling stories together; the dice add elements of uncertainty.

# Character-Centric Storytelling

**Aspects of Nature** was created to facilitate stories with **character-centric** elements:

- **Slice-of-life** - stories involving the challenges of one‚Äôs otherwise mundane, everyday life

- **Drama** - tension that arises between characters with conflicting values and motivations

- **Psychology** - interesting, often contradictory responses that arise when one finds themselves in situations they weren‚Äôt prepared for

- **Moral conflict** - actions and motivations that aren‚Äôt easily categorizable as right or wrong

# Scenes

Gameplay is divided into chunks of interaction, or **scenes**. A scene begins when characters enter a location and the narrator allows characters to interact.

Scenes usually end when characters move to another location, but the narrator may end the scene at any time.

When the current scene ends, a new scene begins.

_Example: A group of friends enters the popular Avians‚Äô Rest cafe in Rosenfeld. The cafe's light aspect crystals cast a warm glow as they settle into a cozy corner booth. A waitress with white feathered wings takes their orders, while nearby, a young dragon-lineage student practices small fire aspect techniques to heat their coffee. When the group decides to head to the shopping district to browse for food and equipment, that scene ends, and a new scene begins at the market square._

# Bonds

Characters define a set of **bonds** representing any relationships they might have, including, but not limited to, relatives, romantic partners, friends, or colleagues.

The **strength** of each bond is represented by a number from -3 to 3, which also determines the **type** of bond:

- **Positive** bond: strength > 0

  _Positive bonds represent a fruitful, healthy relationship._

- **Negative** bond: strength < 0

  _Negative bonds represent a tense, adversarial relationship._

- **Neutral** bond: strength = 0

  _In a neutral bond, you and the related character have little to no strong feelings towards one another. That, or the relationship is awkward, but not particularly positive or negative._

The strength of bonds change over time depending on the manner of event that changes it, as determined by the narrator. The **impact** determines the change amount as such:

- Minor: ¬±1

- Considerable: ¬±2

- Significant: ¬±3 or more

<aside>

Example: you attempt to deceive a sibling and fail. A small white lie one could easily smooth over, like spilling a drink on their favorite shirt, would change the bond‚Äôs strength very little or at all. Something major, like having significantly hurt their chances of getting into a prestigious university, would lower the strength by a lot.

</aside>

The maximum strength of a bond is 3, and remains there until an event decreases it. The minimum strength is -3.

At a strength of -3, the bond is **broken**. Broken bonds require a **significant** increase to heal. Healing a broken bond sets it to any new value as determined by the narrator.

<aside>

Example: you‚Äôre framed for a crime. Unable to prove your innocence, a loved one loses all faith in you, causing a significant impact that drops the bond from 2 to -3.

Later, you manage to prove your innocence. The bond with your loved returns to 2.

</aside>

## Creating Bonds

Over time, you‚Äôll meet certain people in the world who you‚Äôll spend a significant amount of time with, getting to know them better and sharing meaningful experiences. These meaningful experiences or events shared with these people will create new bonds for your character. This also includes negative experiences after repeated interactions with an adversary.

Examples of these events would include:

- Escaping capture with someone

- Thwarting the plan of an adversary

- Saving a person‚Äôs life in some way

- Discovering that all you knew about someone was wrong

After such an event, add a new bond to your list of bonds in the same format as the existing ones. Said events will be determined situationally by the narrator.

## Initial Bonds

I recommend defining at least 2 bonds. Each bond should include:

- The name of the other character (you can define this later)

- Their relationship to you

- The [strength](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e803d8566fb10e0b5130c#1bdb0b885c0e808cb03dd4e71f2629da) of the bond

- Optionally, any additional details for this bond

You can set any number for their initial strength, but I recommend defining **at least one negative bond** for more compelling interactions and character development.

For the bond‚Äôs details, consider these questions to add depth:

- How long has this relationship existed?

- What significant event has most defined this relationship?

- What unspoken expectation does each have of the other?

- What secret might affect this relationship if revealed?

- What underlying tension exists between them?

## Bond Generator

Fleshing out a character‚Äôs background from a blank slate can be difficult. You can use this roll table for ideas, or roll on it to determine the specific relationship a bond represents.

| üé≤  | Relationship                                     |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | Parent                                           |
| 2   | Child                                            |
| 3   | Sibling                                          |
| 4   | Cousin                                           |
| 5   | Aunt / Uncle                                     |
| 6   | Niece / Nephew                                   |
| 7   | Grandparent                                      |
| 8   | Grandchild                                       |
| 9   | Roommate / Housemate                             |
| 10  | Professional (Coworker / Superior / Subordinate) |
| 11  | Educational (Classmate / Teacher / Student)      |
| 12  | Romantic Partner (Current or Former)             |

Then you can make more rolls to narrow a bond further:

1. Determine the type of bond:

- 1-5 ‚Üí Positive

- 6-10 ‚Üí Negative

- 11-12 ‚Üí Neutral

1. If non-neutral, determine the score of the bond:

- 1-4 ‚Üí ¬±1

- 5-8 ‚Üí ¬±2

- 9-12 ‚Üí ¬±3

# Dice Rolls

Dice rolls in **Aspects of Nature** use one or more d12 dice. The number of dice rolled will depend on the situation.

A dice roll will have a number of **successes** depending on the result of each die:

- 9-11 ‚Üí +1 success

- 12 ‚Üí +2 successes (critical!)

- anything else ‚Üí 0 successes

The roll‚Äôs result is the combined number of successes. A roll with 1 or more successes is a **successful roll**. A roll with 0 successes is a **failed roll**.

## Contested Rolls

Use contested rolls to determine the victor of an adversarial situation. Both characters make a roll using the most appropriate attribute for their action. The character with more successes wins the contest.

If there's a tie in successes, the character with the higher attribute score wins. If there's still a tie, both characters may choose to either back down or make another roll.

_Example: A thief tries to pickpocket a merchant in a crowded marketplace. The thief rolls _[_Dexterity_](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80039d7fe6cdf5acf995)_ to attempt the theft stealthily, while the merchant rolls _[_Sense_](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80ab9d0cfad4b7eb2f10)_ to notice the attempt. If the thief gets more successes, they successfully steal the item without being noticed. If the merchant gets more successes, they catch the thief in the act._

# Hits & Fatigue

Hits represent the amount of physical damage you‚Äôve taken. Your max hits equals Strength + Dexterity + 3. When you reach max hits, you go down, and cannot take actions until you‚Äôre healed. Your hits cannot exceed your max‚Äîif they would go over, they get set to the max.

Fatigue represents your physical exhaustion. Your max fatigue equals Sense + Intellect + Presence.

To ‚Äúdeal‚Äù or ‚Äútake‚Äù hits or fatigue means to add it, and to ‚Äúheal‚Äù means to remove it. ‚ÄúTaking damage‚Äù means to take hits.

Reaching max fatigue causes you to take damage. Past max fatigue, every point of fatigue you take becomes a hit instead.

For example: if you have a max fatigue of 5 and you take 7 fatigue, your fatigue becomes 5 and you take 2 hits.

## Recovery

After a scene ends, you may make a **recovery** roll. When making a recovery roll, you may choose which form of recovery you want to make:

- Hits - Roll [Endure](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80d68ac8e515eec2363b), then heal 1 hit per success

- Fatigue - Roll [Focus](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80a38b8ac8e71457aa77), then heal 1 fatigue per success

# Positioning, Movement & Distance

Positions of entities (characters or objects) and distances from one another are determined on a logical, narrative basis. An entity can be **nearby** another entity, or **far away** from them.

Moving closer or far away should also be handled on a narrative basis. If nothing logically impedes a character from reaching their destination, they should be able to freely move there.

Obstacles that would impede movement should be handled situationally:

- smaller hurdles like fences or gaps require a [Maneuver](https://www.notion.so/1b2b0b885c0e80d8808fff1f3c9325e9) action to overcome

- barriers that can‚Äôt simply be walked through would require dealing hits to break it down, such as with [Strike](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80a5896febd5968d4381) or [Burn](https://www.notion.so/1b8b0b885c0e804fa69df048d4a6dfae), or you could [Maneuver](https://www.notion.so/1b2b0b885c0e80d8808fff1f3c9325e9) by climbing over it

_Example: You‚Äôre playing as a member of a group of assassins, and you infiltrate a warehouse to find your target. Your target hired bodyguards to patrol the place and keep watch. Your allies and bodyguards on the ground floor close to the entrance would be nearby, and others elsewhere would be far away._

# Attributes

Attributes represent your character's capabilities in different domains. Characters have a score in each attribute ranging from 1 to 5.

| Attribute | Description                                         |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Intellect | Logic, analysis, understanding                      |
| Presence  | Manipulation, influence over others                 |
| Dexterity | Precision and acrobatics                            |
| Sense     | Finding and picking up on things through the senses |
| Strength  | Applying force and heavy hits                       |

# Actions

Characters interact with the world and others through **actions**, an attempt at affecting the world in some way: to make progress, gain information, assert leverage over another, and so on. Some actions include:

- Busting down a door

- Trying to find a hidden switch into a room

- Narrowly dodging a blast of fire

- Analyzing data to find patterns or connections

- Make a convincing disguise to slip past guards

Make dice rolls for actions that have a chance of failure and/or complication. Pick the most fitting attribute for the action, where the score is the number of dice to roll.

Scale the narrative impact of the action with the number of successes on the roll. Treat failed rolls with a success count of 1, plus an added complication or drawback.

_Example: When trying to notice someone sneaking up on you, a successful roll might reveal their exact position and approach, while a failed roll (with complication) might alert you to their presence but cause you to mistakenly look in the wrong direction, giving them an advantage._

**Reactions** are a type of action used in response to other actions or external effects. Any action can be used as a reaction, but some actions‚Äîthose with the ‚ÄúReaction‚Äù tag‚Äîmay _only_ be used as reactions.

## Skills

Skills are specific types of actions which define various common ways characters interact with the world. Some skills have mechanical effects, such as dealing, healing, or preventing hits depending on how many successes you get.

_Example: Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre playing a tough character with a lot of _[_Strength_](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80028c4cd651eb7aceee)_, but not a lot of _[_Presence_](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e809fa7a7fc0a4a9d0ede)_. It would make sense to be a good intimidator, so you can make _[Untitled](https://www.notion.so/1b8b0b885c0e8105992ae707e57ddc73)_ one of your proficient skills to make up for the low attribute score._

## Skill Points

**Skill points** allow you to give dice bonuses to certain skills (and [aspect skills](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e803d8566fb10e0b5130c#1b8b0b885c0e8080b28fc4202b7263fd)!) of your choosing.

Players start with 5 points. Each point is assigned to a specific skill. Rolls for that skill have +1 die per assigned point.

Skills may only have up to 3 points assigned to them.

| Skill      | Attribute | Effect                                                                                                                                                 | Flavor                                                                                                    | Activation |

# Aspects

Characters manipulate elements of nature called **aspects** to their will, through a practice called **aspect art**.

Characters have a score from 1 to 5 for each aspect representing their level of skill with the aspect.

| Name     | Material                               |
| -------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Darkness | Illusions, reality bending, psychology |
| Light    | Illumination, healing, enhancements    |
| Wind     | Air, sound, weather                    |
| Water    | Liquids, vapor, ice                    |
| Fire     | Flame, heat, tectonics                 |

## Aspect Art

Players can perform aspect art actions by freely describing how they want to use one or more aspects to achieve a particular effect, and the narrator will determine how this plays out. For example, a character might use water aspect art to extinguish a fire by drawing water from a nearby lake.

Alternatively, you may choose from one of many **aspect skills** listed below. You can think of aspect skills as presets for execution and resolution of aspect art.

Some aspect skills can _only_ be used as reactions, to be performed during or immediately following a character's action‚Äîincluding your own‚Äîto affect its outcome.

Because aspect skills are a specific type of [skill](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e803d8566fb10e0b5130c#1b8b0b885c0e802e837ef397dbac439a), aspect skills may also receive [skill points](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e803d8566fb10e0b5130c#1c8b0b885c0e8015812fda2be0aa71ba).

## Aspect Auras & Bonds

Aspects each have their own **aura**. Eisenkind find themselves more attuned with aspects whose auras match their mental and/or emotional state.

[Fire](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e8067a288dfe795fb6849): rage, destruction, vengeance

[Water](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80d7b371d75b75b3ac1e): tranquility, safety, comfort

[Wind](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80db8f1bcbee1368dc31): freedom, mobility, unpredictability

[Light](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e808c85f5e09905d8a87e): wellness, stability, order

[Darkness](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e8011bb89e175042f5180): chaos, tension, uncertainty

[Bonds](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e803d8566fb10e0b5130c#1bdb0b885c0e80a88e37d34e61d7f01f) contribute strongly to your emotional state, and give 1 die to [aspect art](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e803d8566fb10e0b5130c#1b8b0b885c0e8080b28fc4202b7263fd) rolls depending on the sum of your bonds‚Äô strengths:

| Sum of Strengths | +1 to Aspect Rolls                                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |

| 1 or 2           | [Untitled](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80d7b371d75b75b3ac1e) |
| = 0              | [Untitled](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80db8f1bcbee1368dc31) |
| -1 or -2         | [Untitled](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e8067a288dfe795fb6849) |
| ‚â§ -3             | [Untitled](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e8011bb89e175042f5180) |

[Changed bonds](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e803d8566fb10e0b5130c#1bdb0b885c0e80038367d87217d3018f) will shift the determined aspect at the moment that it happens. For example: adding or modifying a bond that brings your sum from 3 to 1 will _immediately_ move your aspect bonus from [Light](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e808c85f5e09905d8a87e) to [Water](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80d7b371d75b75b3ac1e).

Optionally, to reduce bookkeeping, at the narrator's jurisdiction, you may choose to update the determined aspect at the _end_ of a session, rather than at the time of change.

# üöß Items

You may possess a number of **items** which are used in various ways for various benefits.

Each item has a **size** representing how large or heavy it is, and the sum of your carried item sizes must be equal to or less than your **carrying capacity**, which is equal to:

4 + your [Strength](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80028c4cd651eb7aceee) score + your [skill points](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e803d8566fb10e0b5130c#1c8b0b885c0e8015812fda2be0aa71ba) in [Endure](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80d68ac8e515eec2363b)

## Consumable

Consumable items are removed from your inventory after using them. You may use a consumable item at any time while you are _able_ to make actions‚Äîbeing down would prevent you from using them.

## Tool

Tools may be wielded for a persistent effect that applies until you stop wielding it. You may only wield 2 tools at a time‚Äîone for each hand.

## Wearable

A wearable may be worn for a persistent effect that applies until you stop wearing it. You may only wear one wearable at a time.

# Combat

Combat in **Aspects of Nature** isn‚Äôt handled in any special way. However, as an optional rule to make things fair and reduce confusion, you may want to establish a fixed turn order:

- The character who instigated the conflict is the one who goes first

- Next, the person who was impacted

Then, order follows on a logical basis, depending on factors such as:

- Distance to the source of conflict (those closer would go sooner)

- A character‚Äôs speed or reaction time, represented by their [Dexterity](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80039d7fe6cdf5acf995) (those with a higher score would go sooner)

For a more concretely determined order, you may also make competing [Dexterity](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80039d7fe6cdf5acf995) rolls, where those with more successes go before those with less.

Optionally, you can have **teams** of characters‚Äîthose who are narratively allied and working towards or against the same goal‚Äîtake their turns one after another, where initiative is counted on a per-team basis by adding the success count for everyone‚Äôs [Dexterity](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80039d7fe6cdf5acf995) rolls. Your party would take their turns in any order, your adversaries would do the same, as well as any third-party groups that are neutral or enemies to either groups.

You have one action during your turn. If you make a reaction (such as using [Dodge](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80b0bb34ee96169251be)), you forfeit your action for your following turn.

Once per turn, you may use **adrenaline**, which allows you to take 2 fatigue for an additional action.

Using a [consumable item](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e803d8566fb10e0b5130c#1c8b0b885c0e80ad878adbfcdac08b20) does _not_ use an action, but you may only use one item per turn.

Wearing or holding [equipment](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e803d8566fb10e0b5130c#1c8b0b885c0e809281b9c25d3608bd5f) does _not_ use an action, but you may only switch your equipped or wielded item once per turn.

## Define your [bonds](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e803d8566fb10e0b5130c#1bdb0b885c0e80a88e37d34e61d7f01f).

I recommend defining at least 2 bonds. Each bond should include:

- The name of the other character (you can define this later)

- Their relationship to you

- The [strength](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e803d8566fb10e0b5130c#1bdb0b885c0e808cb03dd4e71f2629da) of the bond

- Optionally, any additional details for this bond

You can set any number for their initial strength, but I recommend defining **at least one negative bond** for more compelling interactions and character development.

For the bond‚Äôs details, consider these questions to add depth:

- How long has this relationship existed?

- What significant event has most defined this relationship?

- What unspoken expectation does each have of the other?

- What secret might affect this relationship if revealed?

- What underlying tension exists between them?

Note the appropriate aspect roll bonus based on the sum of the bonds‚Äô strength:

| Sum of Strengths | +1 to Aspect Rolls                                                 |

### Bond Generator

Fleshing out a character‚Äôs background from a blank slate can be difficult. You can use this roll table for ideas, or roll on it to determine the specific relationship a bond represents.

| üé≤  | Relationship                                     |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | Parent                                           |
| 2   | Child                                            |
| 3   | Sibling                                          |
| 4   | Cousin                                           |
| 5   | Aunt / Uncle                                     |
| 6   | Niece / Nephew                                   |
| 7   | Grandparent                                      |
| 8   | Grandchild                                       |
| 9   | Roommate / Housemate                             |
| 10  | Professional (Coworker / Superior / Subordinate) |
| 11  | Educational (Classmate / Teacher / Student)      |
| 12  | Romantic Partner (Current or Former)             |

Then you can make more rolls to narrow a bond further:

1. Determine the type of bond:

- 1-5 ‚Üí Positive

- 6-10 ‚Üí Negative

- 11-12 ‚Üí Neutral

1. If non-neutral, determine the score of the bond:

- 1-4 ‚Üí ¬±1

- 5-8 ‚Üí ¬±2

- 9-12 ‚Üí ¬±3

First, calculate and write down your carrying capacity, which is equal to:

4 + your [Strength](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80028c4cd651eb7aceee) score + your [skill points](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e803d8566fb10e0b5130c#1c8b0b885c0e8015812fda2be0aa71ba) in [Endure](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80d68ac8e515eec2363b)

Then choose your starting items, which can be:

- up to 2 tools

- up to 1 wearable

- up to 3 consumables

Starting items must fit within your carrying capacity. Consult the narrator for custom items.

### Example

Using our [previously chosen scores](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e803d8566fb10e0b5130c#1b6b0b885c0e80e9a0ddd966003466a8) and [skill points](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e803d8566fb10e0b5130c#1bbb0b885c0e8056a32bc51fb8a175ef), our capacity would be:

4 + 3 (Strength) + 0 (Endure) = 7

```markdown
## Items (Capacity 7)

- Dagger (Tool, Size 3) - +1 success on Strike rolls
- Crossbow (Tool, Size 3) - +1 success on Shoot rolls
- Healing Elixir (Consumable, Size 1) - recover 3 hits
```

</aside>

## Finishing touches

- Give your character a name!

- Add backstory, personality, relationships, likes and dislikes, etc. under the **Background** section, with as little or as much detail as you prefer

Once you‚Äôve done everything else, calculate your resource maximums:

- Set max hits: [Strength](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80028c4cd651eb7aceee) + [Dexterity](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80039d7fe6cdf5acf995) + 3

- Set max fatigue: [Sense](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80ab9d0cfad4b7eb2f10) + [Intellect](https://www.notion.so/1b2b0b885c0e8097891bc55d3cadb9dd) + [Presence](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e809fa7a7fc0a4a9d0ede)

```markdown
Hits: 0 / 11

```

Then, with our [lineage ability](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e803d8566fb10e0b5130c#1b8b0b885c0e80feaab1fac3a0aab79a) (+3 max hits):

Hits: 0 / 14
Fatigue: 0 / 7
```

And you‚Äôre done!

# Non-Player Characters

Non-player characters (or NPCs) are created and played by the narrator to make the world feel more alive with additional actors.

<aside>

üöß TODO: figure this out, but the goal is to have some System‚Ñ¢Ô∏è during gameplay that can answer the question: ‚Äúhow many dice should I roll for this NPC using this skill right now?‚Äù

</aside>

An NPCs resources and rolls are determined by their **level**, a number starting at 1 with no maximum. As a guideline, a level 1 character would be a very weak, everyday NPC. A level 5 character would be a formidable opponent. A level 10 character would be able to take on several characters at once.

The NPC level scales various values as follows:

| Value                 | Formula                                | Purpose                                                         |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Primary Resource      | [Level] \* 3                           | Apply to hits or max hits                                       |
| Secondary Resource    | [Level] \* 2                           | Apply to hits or max hits                                       |
| Primary Score         | [Level] (min. 3)                       | Apply to strongest attribute and strongest aspect               |
| Secondary Score       | [Level] / 2 (rounded up, min. 2)       | Apply to second strongest attribute and second strongest aspect |
| Baseline Score        | [Level] / 3 (rounded up, min. 1)       | Apply to all other attribute and aspect scores                  |
| Primary Skill Bonus   | [Level] \* 0.75 (rounded down, min. 1) | Apply to their primary skill                                    |
| Secondary Skill Bonus | [Level] \* 0.25 (rounded up)           | Apply to their primary skill                                    |

These values are only a guide; you may deviate from this guide and choose **any** value for NPC scores and bonuses as appropriate.

Additionally, narrators may determine the impact of an NPC action narratively and use a constant number, rather than relying solely on dice. For example, a master assassin should feel deadly, and if the dice don't support that narrative, the story should take precedence.

# Milestones

**Milestones** are events where you and your group reach a major stepping stone in the story. After a milestone, you may upgrade your character in one of a few ways:

- Gain 2 skill points

- Gain 1 max hit (up to 3 times)

- Gain 1 max fatigue (up to 3 times)

When choosing an upgrade, add a new ‚ÄúMilestones‚Äù section on your character sheet if you don‚Äôt have one. Then add a note for the milestone that was achieved and the corresponding upgrade.

<aside>

### Example

```markdown
# Milestones

- +2 skill points - Found the required artifact to locate the Evilest Villain
- +1 max hit - Thwarted the Evilest Villan's plans
```

</aside>

After you‚Äôve done that, apply the corresponding update. For example, if you chose to gain skill points, update your ‚ÄúSkill Points‚Äù section to the correct number of points you should have, then specify new or skills to receive points.

# üöß The World of Eisenwald

## Eisenkind

Eisenwald is populated by human-like people, or **Eisenkind**, with features of animals, such as dogs, cats, foxes, and birds, as well as other fantasy races like dragons and demons. Eisenkind exist alongside animals of their lineages, as well as a breadth of other fanatical creatures and mixes thereof.

### Names

Eisenkind receive elaborate single names at birth, often accompanied by a shorter nickname used in casual conversation. These names are written as ‚ÄúFullname ‚ÄòNickname‚Äô‚Äù (for example, ‚ÄúLunaria ‚ÄòLuna‚Äô‚Äù or ‚ÄúSaphira ‚ÄòSaph‚Äô‚Äù).

While Eisenkind do not use family names in the traditional sense, relatives often share naming elements or patterns to signify their connection. Siblings might have names beginning with the same prefix or ending with similar sounds. For example, siblings named "Lumina 'Mina'" and "Lunaria 'Luna'" share the "Lu-" prefix, while cousins "Fernspire 'Fern'" and "Stormspire 'Storm'" share the "-spire" suffix.

Eisenkind names typically consist of two or more elements combined to create melodic, distinctive names. Below are common name elements that can be combined to create authentic Eisenkind names. Players can roll a d12 on each list to randomly generate name components.

Remember: these are only examples. Feel free to alter letters, leave off parts, or come up with your own elements to make something that sounds right.
