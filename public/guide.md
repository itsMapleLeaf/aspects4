# Aspects of Nature: Guidebook

## Rules

### Story First

In **Aspects of Nature**, the narrative drives everything‚Äîmechanics serve the story, not the other way around. When players want to accomplish something, they describe their intended actions in detail, and the **narrator** (the facilitator of the game, a.k.a the ‚Äúgame master‚Äù) determines what [rolls](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e803d8566fb10e0b5130c#1b1b0b885c0e80e1a1afd501f2cb10d5) (if any) are needed based on the narrative context. For example, if a character wants to leap across a chasm while avoiding enemy fire, the narrator might call for a [Maneuver](https://www.notion.so/1b2b0b885c0e80d8808fff1f3c9325e9) roll for the acrobatic movement.

Even mechanical effects like [damage and fatigue](https://www.notion.so/1e5b0b885c0e801da514d402a2a15a37) should be woven into the story. Standing in a fire doesn't just mean "take X damage per round" - the narrator describes how the flames affect the character, and may call for [Endure](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80d68ac8e515eec2363b) rolls to resist the heat, or [Focus](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80a38b8ac8e71457aa77) rolls to maintain concentration through the pain.

When using [aspect art](https://www.notion.so/1b8b0b885c0e80809c18c6e0ccc7ab05#1b8b0b885c0e8080b28fc4202b7263fd), the narrator should encourage players to creatively describe their technique. Rather than simply saying "I attack with fire," a player might describe how they draw heat from nearby torches, condensing it into a spiraling flame that seeks out their target. The narrator then interprets these narrative choices and applies the appropriate mechanical effects.

This story-first approach means that, while the game has clear rules and mechanics, they exist to _enhance_ the narrative experience rather than restrict it. The goal is to create compelling stories together, where the dice add elements of uncertainty.

#### Character-Centric Storytelling

**Aspects of Nature** was created to facilitate stories with **character-centric** elements:

- **Slice-of-life** - stories involving the challenges of one‚Äôs otherwise mundane, everyday life

- **Drama** - tension that arises between characters with conflicting values and motivations

- **Psychology** - interesting, often contradictory responses that arise when one finds themselves in situations they weren‚Äôt prepared for

- **Moral conflict** - actions and motivations that aren‚Äôt easily categorizable as right or wrong

### Scenes

Gameplay is divided into chunks of interaction, or **scenes**. A scene begins when characters enter a location and the narrator allows characters to interact.

Scenes usually end when characters move to another location, but the narrator may end the scene at any time.

When the current scene ends, a new scene begins.

_Example: A group of friends enters the popular Avians‚Äô Rest cafe in Rosenfeld. The cafe's light aspect crystals cast a warm glow as they settle into a cozy corner booth. A waitress with white feathered wings takes their orders, while nearby, a young dragon-lineage student practices small fire aspect techniques to heat their coffee. When the group decides to head to the shopping district to browse for food and equipment, that scene ends, and a new scene begins at the market square._

### Conditions

The **conditions** listed on your character sheet represent your changing state over time. This includes various forms of physical and mental stress, or boons that amplify your abilities.

The narrator adds conditions in response to various events, such as taking damage from an attack, exhausting yourself from a taxing action, or using an [item](https://www.notion.so/1b8b0b885c0e801ba751e644e7841a85) and gaining its benefits.

**Variable conditions** (denoted by ‚ÄúCondition X‚Äù) have an **intensity,** a _positive whole number_ (a condition can‚Äôt have an intensity of 0, or a negative number) that represents the impact of the condition.

The following conditions exist as a part of the system with special meanings and mechanical purposes:

**Damage X** - physical harm resulting from attacks, hazards, or other external forces

    _By default, damage is represented in a more abstract, cartoonish sort of way, as opposed to a  ‚Äúmedical‚Äù approach that describes bleeding or broken bones in detail._

**Fatigue X** - exhaustion accumulated from physically or mentally taxing activities

**Unconscious** - a state in which the character cannot move, act, or perceive the surrounding world in any way

**Burn X** - when taking damage, take X additional damage

**Cold X** - when taking fatigue, take X additional fatigue

<aside>

‚ÑπÔ∏è Damage and Fatigue both fall under a stress system. See [Stress](https://www.notion.so/1edb0b885c0e807ab0b5f881a026cac3) for more details.

</aside>

However, the narrator may apply other unlisted, custom conditions to characters when built-in conditions don‚Äôt fit, such as a specific type of ‚Äúpoisoned‚Äù condition, which impairs a certain set of abilities.

You can have any number of conditions at once, but any condition may only be listed once. Receiving some level of the condition when it already exists will increase the intensity of the existing condition instead of adding a new one.

Language for modifying conditions is loose; to ‚Äútake 2 fatigue‚Äù would mean to add the Fatigue condition with an intensity of 2. Similarly, ‚Äúheal 2 damage‚Äù would mean to reduce the intensity of the Damage condition. Other examples:

- ‚ÄúBecome unconscious‚Äù - take the **Unconscious** condition

- ‚ÄúBecome blinded‚Äù - take the **Blinded** condition

_Example: a character could have Damage 5 and Fatigue 3 conditions. This would mean that they‚Äôve taken a decent bit of damage, as well as having physically exhausted themselves. Taking 2 damage from an attack would increase the intensity of their existing Damage condition to 7._

### Stress

The **Damage** and **Fatigue** [conditions](https://www.notion.so/1e5b0b885c0e801da514d402a2a15a37) both represent forms of **stress**.

The **limits** of stress conditions are numbers which depend on your [attribute scores](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80bd9d24c363bc9a1c01):

Your **damage limit** is your [Strength](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80028c4cd651eb7aceee) + [Dexterity](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80039d7fe6cdf5acf995) scores.

Your **fatigue limit** is your [Sense](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80ab9d0cfad4b7eb2f10) + [Intellect](https://www.notion.so/1b2b0b885c0e8097891bc55d3cadb9dd) + [Presence](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e809fa7a7fc0a4a9d0ede) scores.

Stress conditions cannot exceed their respective limits.

<aside>

**Example:** Let‚Äôs say you have the following scores:

[Strength](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80028c4cd651eb7aceee): 1

[Dexterity](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80039d7fe6cdf5acf995): 3

[Sense](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80ab9d0cfad4b7eb2f10): 3

[Intellect](https://www.notion.so/1b2b0b885c0e8097891bc55d3cadb9dd): 5

[Presence](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e809fa7a7fc0a4a9d0ede): 3

Your damage limit would be 4 (1 + 3) and your fatigue limit would be 11 (3 + 5 + 3).

If you have Damage 3, then you take 2 damage, the intensity of your damage condition gets limited to Damage 4.

</aside>

#### Overload

<aside>

üöß TODO: rename this to ‚Äúperil"

</aside>

If taking stress causes you to reach either limit, your character **becomes overloaded**, a state in which you must make **overload rolls** to stay conscious.

When becoming overloaded:

1. Take the **Overload 1** condition.

1. Make an **overload roll**.

While overloaded:

- You must make an overload roll before making an [action roll](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80d5bb9ce5178ed7b7f4).

- You must make an overload roll after taking any amount of damage.

- The intensity of your Overload condition **cannot exceed 5.**

- You **remain overloaded** while you have the overload condition.

- Once all stress conditions have been healed below their limit, remove the Overload condition.

Overload rolls are made with a standard six-sided die with numbers from 1 to 6 _(and ****not**** the special _[_action die_](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80d5bb9ce5178ed7b7f4#1b1b0b885c0e80e1a1afd501f2cb10d5)_)_.

If you roll higher than your current overload intensity, increase it by 1.

If you roll _less than or equal to_ your overload number:

1. You may activate **desperation**: if an action roll caused you to make this overload roll, carry out that action with a **doubled result** of the action roll.

1. Become [**unconscious**](https://www.notion.so/1e5b0b885c0e801da514d402a2a15a37#1e5b0b885c0e800399bee0ae34ce8a0d).

1. Remove your overload condition.

<aside>

**Example:** Your fatigue limit is 11 and you‚Äôre currently at Fatigue 9.

You make an action which requires taking 2 fatigue and causes you to reach your limit of 11.

Reaching your fatigue limit causes you become overloaded; you now have the Overload 1 condition.

Becoming overloaded requires you to make an overload roll. You must roll higher than your current overload number, which is 1.

Rolling a 3, you manage to stay up, but your overload condition intensifies: you now have Overload 2.

Then, you take damage from an enemy. Because you‚Äôre overloaded, you must make another overload roll.

You must roll higher than your current overload number, which is 2.

You roll a 5 and manage to stay up. You now have Overload 3.

You retaliate against the enemy. Doing so while overloaded requires another overload roll.

You roll a 1, failing to stay up. However, you choose to activate **desperation**. You carry out the action and deal a massive blow to the enemy before you go down.

You are now unconscious and no longer overloaded.

</aside>

### Resting

You may heal 1 fatigue per 1 in-game hour spent resting. If you rest for 8 consecutive hours, heal all fatigue.

Resting for any amount of time will also restore 1 [bond activation](https://www.notion.so/1bdb0b885c0e80a88e37d34e61d7f01f), to a max of 3.

### Positioning, Movement & Distance

Positions of entities (characters or objects) and distances from one another are determined on a logical, narrative basis. An entity can be **nearby** another entity, or **far away** from them.

Moving closer or far away should also be handled on a narrative basis. If nothing logically impedes a character from reaching their destination, they should be able to freely move there.

Obstacles that would impede movement should be handled situationally:

- smaller hurdles like fences or gaps require a [Maneuver](https://www.notion.so/1b2b0b885c0e80d8808fff1f3c9325e9) action to overcome

- barriers that can‚Äôt simply be walked through would require breaking it down, such as with [Strike](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80a5896febd5968d4381), or you could [Maneuver](https://www.notion.so/1b2b0b885c0e80d8808fff1f3c9325e9) by climbing over it

_Example: You‚Äôre playing as a member of a group of assassins, and you infiltrate a warehouse to find your target. Your target hired bodyguards to patrol the place and keep watch. Your allies and bodyguards on the ground floor close to the entrance would be nearby, and others elsewhere would be far away._

### Attributes

Attributes represent your character's capabilities in different domains. Characters have a score in each attribute ranging from 1 to 5.

| Attribute | Description                                         |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Intellect | Logic, analysis, understanding                      |
| Presence  | Manipulation, influence over others                 |
| Dexterity | Precision and acrobatics                            |
| Sense     | Finding and picking up on things through the senses |
| Strength  | Applying force and heavy hits                       |

### Actions

Characters interact with the world and others through **actions**, an attempt at affecting the world in some way: to make progress, gain information, assert leverage over another, and so on. Some actions include:

- Busting down a door

- Trying to find a hidden switch into a room

- Narrowly dodging a blast of fire

- Analyzing data to find patterns or connections

- Make a convincing disguise to slip past guards

**Reactions** are a type of action used in response to other actions or external effects. Unless stated otherwise, any action can be made as a reaction.

If the action is trivial in nature without any real change of failure or complication, such as opening an unlocked, unblocked door, or pressing a button, the narrator should let the player proceed with the action and narrate what happens next.

If the action has some chance of failure or complication, that‚Äôs where **action rolls** come in.

#### Action Rolls

To make an action roll, choose the most appropriate [attribute](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e803d8566fb10e0b5130c#1b1b0b885c0e80bd9d24c363bc9a1c01) for the action, then roll a number of six-sided dice equal to the character‚Äôs score for that attribute.

The **value** of each die depends on the face that it lands on. An action roll die has:

- three faces with a value of 1

- two faces with a value of 2

- one face with a value of 3

You can represent action dice with common numerical dice by assigning a value to each number according to the dice-value table.

The roll‚Äôs **result** is the **value** of each die added together.

_Example: you make a\_\_ _[_Strength_](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80028c4cd651eb7aceee)_ roll. Since you have a _[_Strength_](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80028c4cd651eb7aceee)_ score of 4, you‚Äôll roll 4 dice**. The dice land on 1, 4, 2, and 6. The value of each die is 1, 2, 1, and 3 respectively. Add them together, and you get a result of ****7**\_\_._

When rolling, the narrator determines a **difficulty tier** that describes how difficult the action is. Each tier defines a **requirement**, a result which must be met to avoid failure or complications.

| Face | Value |
| ---- | ----- |
| 1    | **1** |
| 2    | **1** |
| 3    | **1** |
| 4    | **2** |
| 5    | **2** |
| 6    | **3** |

| Tier        | Requirement | Description                                                             |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Simple      | 3           | Basic tasks with no real pressure. Anyone competent should pull it off. |
| Routine     | 6           | Standard challenges; requires some skill or focus, but nothing special. |
| Challenging | 9           | You‚Äôll want solid stats and maybe some help.                            |
| Harrowing   | 12          | A feat few can pull off. High risk, high reward. Expect to fail often.  |
| Draconic    | 15          | Good luck!                                                              |

If the roll‚Äôs result meets the requirement, the action succeeds without any complication. If the roll does not meet the requirement, the narrator may consider the action a failure and prevent it, or let the action succeed with an added complication.

_Some tier requirements can‚Äôt even be met unless you roll a certain number of dice. For example: you can‚Äôt meet a task of Challenging difficulty with only 1 die, which can only give you a max of 3. As the narrator, you may consider such a roll for this task as an automatic failure and eschew the actual dice roll. Alternatively, you may let them make the roll and avoid some amount of complication with a higher result, even if they can‚Äôt meet the requirement._

##### Push Yourself

After you make a roll, once per roll, you may take 2 fatigue to **push yourself** and reroll it, then take the new result if it‚Äôs higher than the previous.

##### Contested Rolls

Use contested rolls to determine the victor of an adversarial situation. Both characters make a roll using the most appropriate attribute for their action. The character with more successes wins the contest.

If there's a tie in successes, the character with the higher attribute score wins. If there's still a tie, both characters may choose to either back down or make another roll.

_Example: A thief tries to pickpocket a merchant in a crowded marketplace. The thief rolls _[_Dexterity_](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80039d7fe6cdf5acf995)_ to attempt the theft stealthily, while the merchant rolls _[_Sense_](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80ab9d0cfad4b7eb2f10)_ to notice the attempt. If the thief rolls higher, they successfully steal the item without being noticed. If the merchant rolls higher, they catch the thief in the act._

### Skills

Your character‚Äôs skillset is informed by the **skill points** assigned to each **skill**. When making an action roll, certain skills may give bonuses to the roll when relevant. For example: when making an action roll to break a window, the [Strike](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80a5896febd5968d4381) skill would be applicable.

Players start with 5 skill points, and skills may only have up to 5 points assigned to them. You may reassign any number of skill points at the start or end of sessions.

| Skill      | Attribute | Effect                                                                                                      | Flavor                                                                                                    | Activation |

### Unarmed Combat

At any time, you may make the following [actions](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80d5bb9ce5178ed7b7f4), each with the dice bonus from its associated [skill](https://www.notion.so/1b8b0b885c0e802e837ef397dbac439a):

- [Strike](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80a5896febd5968d4381): Make an action roll. Deal damage equal to the result to a nearby target.

- [Block](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80c3baede9bc830d6ece): As a reaction, before taking damage, make an action roll. Reduce the incoming damage by the result, but to no less than 1.

- [Dodge](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80b0bb34ee96169251be): As a reaction, before taking damage, make an action roll. If the result is higher than the damage taken, avoid all damage.

_Example: You currently have no weapon, and you want to punch another nearby character. You would make the unarmed _[_Strike_](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80a5896febd5968d4381)_ action. If you have skill points assigned to the _[_Strike_](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80a5896febd5968d4381)_ skill, add that many dice to your action roll._

### Items

You may possess a number of **items** which are used in various ways to various ends.

Each item has a **size** representing how large and heavy it is. The sum of your carried item sizes must be equal to or less than your **carrying capacity**, which is equal to:

4 + your [Strength](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80028c4cd651eb7aceee) score + your [skill points](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80d5bb9ce5178ed7b7f4#1c8b0b885c0e8015812fda2be0aa71ba) in [Endure](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80d68ac8e515eec2363b)

Items may have a number of limited **uses**, which can represent a number of servings, doses, durability, ammo, and so on, depending on the item itself.

The described effects of items are written and interpreted narratively. When using an item, players should make their case for how the item applies to the current situation, and it‚Äôs up to the narrator whether that item use is valid.

_Example: a medkit would be to help heal physical injuries. Players could use it to heal a ‚Äúwounded‚Äù _[_condition_](https://www.notion.so/1e5b0b885c0e801da514d402a2a15a37)_, but not to cure the effects of sickness or poisoning._

Likewise, modify item inventories on a sensible bases, even if item descriptions don‚Äôt state to do so.

_Example: throwing a weapon would remove it from your inventory, even if the weapon itself doesn‚Äôt say ‚Äúremoved from your inventory when thrown‚Äù._

The **cost** of an item is the minimum [expense tier](https://www.notion.so/1c8b0b885c0e80c680d1d4411eef8ede) you need to buy it in a setting of commerce or trade.

**Consumable** items are removed from your inventory after they have run out of uses. You may use a consumable item at any time while you are _able_ to make actions‚Äîbeing down would prevent you from using them.

**Tools** may be held, used, and used while they have at least 1 use. They continue to stay in your inventory, even while they have run out of uses.

**Wearable** items may be worn for a persistent effect that applies until you stop wearing it.

Items are designed to be created by players in collaboration with the narrator. To define an custom item, define the item‚Äôs name, type (Consumable, Tool, or Wearable), size, and effect. Always consult the narrator for custom items.

Use this list of items as a reference for your own custom items.

### Aspects

Characters manipulate elements of nature called **aspects** to their will, through a practice called **aspect art**.

Characters have a score from 1 to 5 for each aspect representing their level of skill with the aspect.

You may only use aspects in which you have a score of 1 or higher, or if an effect gives you bonus dice on a 0-score aspect which would allow you to roll with it. This restriction also applies to [minor aspect art](https://www.notion.so/1b8b0b885c0e80809c18c6e0ccc7ab05#1e5b0b885c0e80c9bcb3eaaf3b440d6c), even if you don‚Äôt make rolls with it.

| Name     | Material                               |
| -------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Darkness | Illusions, reality bending, psychology |
| Light    | Illumination, healing, enhancements    |
| Wind     | Air, sound, weather                    |
| Water    | Liquids, vapor, ice                    |
| Fire     | Flame, heat, tectonics                 |

#### Aspect Art

Aspect art actions allow you to compose several parts to define the mechanical impact of an aspect art. Aspect art actions may be used as [reactions](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80d5bb9ce5178ed7b7f4#1b8b0b885c0e808fb835e607c32816dc).

To perform an aspect art, follow these steps in any order.

_(Click the arrow on each step to expand for more details.)_

- Choose the aspects with which which you‚Äôre making the roll. Take 1 fatigue per chosen aspect _(including the first)_.

_If using an _[_aspect skill_](https://www.notion.so/1b8b0b885c0e80809c18c6e0ccc7ab05#1cbb0b885c0e8031a981dc38bc6e9024)_, add any applicable bonuses._

The result is the number of **impact points** you may spend for this art to strengthen the impact of the art in various ways _(you may choose to spend none)_.

Each type of aspect art comes with its own nuances.

Additionally, all non-enchantment types include _both modification and removal_ of physical manifestations, except for [Water](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80d7b371d75b75b3ac1e), which only allows modification (you can‚Äôt create or destroy water).

_Properties apply to targets that make contact with the projectile, after which, the projectile is destroyed, and its properties cannot be applied again. \_\_**This includes any obstacles that would intercept it while moving towards an intended target.**_

_Any number of times, you may spend 1 impact point to apply additional enhancements:_

- _**Spread**\_\_: one additional projectile_

  _The new projectile inherits every property of the first. You may choose its direction or target separately from the first._

- _**Reinforce:**\_\_ one extra hit & application of properties_

  _This also applies to additional projectiles._

  _The narrator should determine what happens on contact instead of getting destroyed, such as (but not limited to):_

  - _bouncing off of the target and towards another, chosen either by you, the narrator, or at random_

  - _piercing the target_

  - _phasing through the target_

_Properties apply immediately when performing the art._

_You may spend 1 impact point for an additional target._

<aside>

üöß TODO: probably scale cost with distance when we figure that out

</aside>

_Properties apply on touch._

_The size or complexity of the construct should scale with the result of the roll._

_Example: with a roll of 3 or less, you would be able to work with a solid volume the size of an apple, or a bucket-sized vaporous volume. With a roll of 15 or higher, you‚Äôd be able to work with solid volumes the size of a small house, and vaporous volumes the size of a courtyard area._

_The narrator should use their best judgement to determine what allowable size feels right._

_Properties apply to the item at your discretion. Example: if you wanted to make a sword-like construct, you could apply the Damage property, choosing to have it apply on contact when swinging it._

<aside>

üöß TODO: determine how size/uses work

</aside>

_When making an environmental art, the environmental modification stays in play until you take another action to destroy it, during which you may not move or perform any other aspect arts._

_Properties apply when targets first move into the area, ****and**** each time they move ****within**** the area (and ****not**** when they exit)._

When choosing a property, assign any number of impact points to the property to increase its intensity. You cannot use the same impact points on multiple properties.

Available properties include:

**Damage **- deal 1 damage per impact point to yourself or a target

**Healing **- heal 1 damage or negative condition per impact point to yourself or a target

**Shield **- as a reaction, prevent 1 damage per impact point against a target

**Enhance **- add 1 die per impact point to a character‚Äôs next roll with a chosen skill

**Weaken **- subtract 1 die per impact point from a character‚Äôs next roll with a chosen skill (to no less than 1)

**Exhaust **- deal 1 fatigue per impact point

**Shift** - move a target‚Äôs position

**Blast** - apply this art to other nearby targets

<aside>

üöß TODO: also add impact to shift and blasting when we figure out distance

</aside>

A condition is any arbitrary statement that specifies additional clauses or rules for your art, such as the targets it applies to, the manner in which it applies, and so on. However, you _cannot_ write a condition that would do the same as adding, removing, or changing a property of the art.

_Example: you could exclude specific characters or categories of targets from being affected, such as: _

- _yourself_

- _allies_

- _characters with water as their highest aspect score_

_You could also delaying its activation until another character makes a certain action or moves to a specific location, making it work similarly to a trap._

_However, you ****cannot**** declare a condition that doubles damage on certain targets, for example._

This may include, but is not limited to:

- The specific movements being made

- The shapes and forms that the material aspects take

- The intent and emotion felt while making the art, and how that defines it

_Something simple like ‚ÄúI hurl a fireball at this guy because he stole from me‚Äù works, too! At the end of the day, the goal here is to first imagine what you want to do, then you can have fun defining the specifics afterward._

You can follow these steps in any order. Once you‚Äôve described your art, execute its effects mechanically depending on its properties and condition.

_**Note:**\_\_ The narrator may apply additional mechanical effects and/or require additional fatigue for the art where it makes sense, even if the art doesn‚Äôt have the associated property. For example: you could perform a water art to freeze someone‚Äôs feet to the floor. This could effectively act as a Weaken property for _[_Maneuver_](https://www.notion.so/1b2b0b885c0e80d8808fff1f3c9325e9)_, even if it was performed as a plain construct art._

<aside>

**Example:** You want to summon a blinding, searing beam of [Light](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e808c85f5e09905d8a87e) upon an enemy. While this fits the description of a **Construct**, the narrator could decide that this functions more like a **Projectile**, as it‚Äôs targeted and only exists for a brief moment. This allows you to add additional targets, if you wanted.

As you want to damage _and_ weaken their senses, you would apply the Damage and Weaken properties.

The fatigue cost is 3: 1 for the light aspect, and 2 for the properties.

You roll a 7, which gives you 7 points to assign to the intensity of each property in any way. You could assign 5 points to the **Damage** property to deal 5 damage, then assign 2 points to the **Weaken** property to remove 2 dice from their next [Notice](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e804c8f88ffa3fd4c180d) roll.

</aside>

<aside>

**Example:** You want to create a gust of wind to quickly propel yourself to a higher surface. The narrator decides that this is a **Projectile**, for reasons similar to the previous example.

You would make a [Wind](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80db8f1bcbee1368dc31) aspect art, applying the **Shift** property to move yourself up. The use of wind and the property would make this art cost 2 fatigue.

As you‚Äôre only aiming to move yourself, the narrator could allow you to succeed with a roll of 3 or higher.

</aside>

##### Aspect Art Modifiers

Aspect arts are modified by the aspects used in them in various ways, such as adding additional side effects or having certain requirements and drawbacks.

###### [Fire](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e8067a288dfe795fb6849)

- Inflicts a Burn 1 condition on damaged targets.

- Inflicts a Burn 1 condition on the _user_ when rolling with 3 or more impact points.

  _Burn X - when taking damage, take X additional damage_

- Cannot use while inflicted with Cold, or in a cold environment (below freezing).

###### [Water](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80d7b371d75b75b3ac1e)

- Gives +2 impact to existing Shield properties.

- Inflicts a Cold 1 condition on damaged targets.

  _Cold X - when taking fatigue, take X additional fatigue_

- Cannot use without a source of water nearby.

  _High humidity in a small room counts as a bucket-sized source, as well as rain, clouds, and similar dispersed volumes. Workable volume limits depend on the size of the source._

###### [Wind](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80db8f1bcbee1368dc31)

- Projectile and environmental arts always have the Shift property.

  _Adding Shift does not cost an impact point._

  _This also applies to aspect skills: they are always predefined with Shift, but it does not cost an impact point in usage._

- Cannot use in vacuum zones.

###### [Light](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e808c85f5e09905d8a87e)

- Gives +1 impact to existing Healing and Enhance properties.

- Gives +1 impact point to Enchantment arts.

- Non-enchantments have -1 impact point in dark spaces.

###### [Darkness](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e8011bb89e175042f5180)

- Gives +1 impact to existing Weaken and Exhaust properties.

- Gives +1 impact point outdoors at night.

- Non-enchantments have -1 impact point in well-lit spaces.

##### Minor Aspect Art

**Minor aspect arts** are narrative-only, do not require action rolls or taking fatigue, and cannot have properties or conditions applied to them. Some examples:

[Fire](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e8067a288dfe795fb6849) - making a candle light worth of flame, generating heat up to a mammal‚Äôs internal body temperature, manipulating a handful of molten rock, or cracking any similarly-sized small rock with heat

[Water](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80d7b371d75b75b3ac1e) - producing a small puddle‚Äôs worth of liquid, lightly cooling an object to just above freezing, forming a palm-sized sphere of vapor or mist, or freezing a shallow cup‚Äôs worth of water into ice

[Wind](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80db8f1bcbee1368dc31) - creating a breeze strong enough to flutter paper, amplifying sound like a whisper into a speaking voice, gently redirecting falling leaves, or clearing a thin layer of dust from a surface

[Light](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e808c85f5e09905d8a87e) - emitting a glow as bright as a small lantern, causing a tiny object to shimmer with radiant energy

[Darkness](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e8011bb89e175042f5180) - dimming the light in a small room corner, a palm-sized illusion or distortion, or inducing a fleeting sense of unease in a target

#### Aspect Skills

**Aspect skills** are predefined [aspect art](https://www.notion.so/1b8b0b885c0e80809c18c6e0ccc7ab05#1b8b0b885c0e8080b28fc4202b7263fd) compositions defined by players in collaboration with the narrator. Aspect skills represent effective, well-trained techniques, and may receive [skill points](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80d5bb9ce5178ed7b7f4#1c8b0b885c0e8015812fda2be0aa71ba).

Aspect skills are learned through **aspect experience**. When making an action roll for aspect art, **you earn one aspect experience point for every die with a value of 3.**

At any time, you may spend 10 aspect experience points to create a new aspect skill.

To create a new aspect skill, define it the same way you would define an aspect art, by choosing an aspect, type, and optionally a set of properties and a condition. Then choose a name and narrative description for the skill. Properties with additional choices (such as the skill associated with the Enhance property) should be decided at the time of [_using_](https://www.notion.so/1b8b0b885c0e80809c18c6e0ccc7ab05#1ebb0b885c0e80088b7fdcaae49b21c8)[ the aspect skill](https://www.notion.so/1b8b0b885c0e80809c18c6e0ccc7ab05#1ebb0b885c0e80088b7fdcaae49b21c8).

Once you‚Äôve decided on all of the details, add your new skill under your list of skill proficiencies. You may optionally assign other skill points to it, denoting that with a number next to the name.

<aside>

###### Example

```markdown
## Skill Points: 5

(other skills)

Thunderclap (+1) (Wind, Construct, Damage + Weaken + Blast) - Create a loud, thunderous noise powerful enough to induce weakness.
```

</aside>

After adding and committing to the new aspect skill, you may only change its details (or that of any number of previous skills) at the start or end of sessions‚Äî_not_ in the middle.

##### Using Aspect Skills

When using an aspect skill, the procedure is the same as performing an aspect art, except that your impact points _must_ go towards the predefined components of the aspect skill. If you roll fewer impact points than would be needed to fulfil every component, you may choose which components from the skill to use.

**You do not take fatigue for impact points spent on the aspect skill‚Äôs components**. You _do_ take fatigue for any extra components, and you still take 1 per aspect used.

##### Example Aspect Skills

Instead of making up a new skill from scratch, feel free to pick from this list of examples, or you can use it as inspiration for creating your own.

#### Aspect Auras

Aspects each have their own **aura**. Eisenkind find themselves more attuned with aspects whose auras match their mental and/or emotional state.

[Fire](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e8067a288dfe795fb6849): rage, destruction, vengeance

[Water](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80d7b371d75b75b3ac1e): tranquility, safety, comfort

[Wind](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80db8f1bcbee1368dc31): freedom, mobility, unpredictability

[Light](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e808c85f5e09905d8a87e): wellness, stability, order

[Darkness](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e8011bb89e175042f5180): chaos, tension, uncertainty

### Bonds

Characters define a set of **bonds** representing any relationships they might have, including, but not limited to, relatives, romantic partners, friends, or colleagues.

The **strength** of each bond is represented by a number from 1 to 5. Lower numbers represent a weaker bond, those which developed recently or seldomly. Higher numbers represent a strong, significant bond, culminated of several experiences and revelations between the two parties.

The **aura** of a bond represents the nature of the bond, corresponding with [aspect auras](https://www.notion.so/1b8b0b885c0e80809c18c6e0ccc7ab05#1beb0b885c0e8082aa4cf4202c8b19ac):

[Fire](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e8067a288dfe795fb6849) indicates an adversarial, heated, conflict-heavy relationship.

[Water](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80d7b371d75b75b3ac1e) comes from notions of comfort, peace, and protection.

[Wind](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80db8f1bcbee1368dc31) exhibits in turbulent relationships full of excitement and change.

[Light](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e808c85f5e09905d8a87e) represents diplomatic relationships built on fairness and respect.

[Darkness](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e8011bb89e175042f5180) manifests from tension, mistrust, and uncertainty.

A bond‚Äôs strength and aura are defined at the time of its creation, and may change over time.

<aside>

üöß TODO: describe asymmetric bonds and/or bonds between PCs

</aside>

##### Initial Bonds

When defining the initial bonds for your character, **the strength of them should add to 7**. You could define two bonds strengths of 2 and 5, or three bonds with strengths of 1, 4, and 2, and so on.

Each one should list the following:

- The name of the other character (you can define this later)

- Their relationship to you

- The strength and aura of the bond

- Optionally, any additional details for this bond

To help define your bonds, as well as add depth and intrigue, consider these questions:

- How long has this relationship existed?

- What significant event has most defined this relationship?

- What unspoken expectation does each have of the other?

- What secret might affect this relationship if revealed?

- What underlying tension exists between them?

##### Bond Generator

Fleshing out a character‚Äôs background from a blank slate can be difficult. Use this roll table to generate them randomly.

Define a bond by rolling once per column: once for the relationship, once for the strength, and once for the Aura, rerolling if necessary.

After determining the bond, optionally name the other person of the bond and add additional details about the relationship.

| üé≤  | Relationship                                     | Strength   | Aura                                                               |

##### Creating Bonds

Over time, you‚Äôll meet certain people in the world who you‚Äôll spend a significant amount of time with, getting to know them better and sharing meaningful experiences. These meaningful experiences or events shared with these people will create new bonds for your character. This also includes negative experiences after repeated interactions with an adversary.

Examples of these events would include:

- Escaping capture with someone

- Thwarting the plan of an adversary

- Saving a person‚Äôs life in some way

- Discovering that all you knew about someone was wrong

After such an event, add a new bond to your list of bonds in the same format as the existing ones. Said events will be determined situationally by the narrator.

##### Changing Bonds

Shared experiences and interactions between you and your bonds will strengthen them over time. Such significant events will increase the strength of the bond, change its aura, or both, as determined by the narrator.

A bond‚Äôs changing aura represents a shift in the very nature of the bond. For example: a bond with a [Light](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e808c85f5e09905d8a87e) aura, built on a rigid, distant sense of equity or respect, may change to [Water](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80d7b371d75b75b3ac1e) when becoming closer, more comfortable, and less diplomatic with the other party.

<aside>

Example: you attempt to deceive a sibling and fail. A small white lie one could easily smooth over, like spilling a drink on their favorite shirt, would change the bond‚Äôs strength very little or not at all. Something major, like having significantly hurt their chances of getting into a prestigious university, would likely shift the aura of the bond.

</aside>

<aside>

Example: you‚Äôre framed for a crime. Unable to prove your innocence, a loved one loses all faith in you, causing a shift from [Water](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80d7b371d75b75b3ac1e) to [Darkness](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e8011bb89e175042f5180). Later, when you manage to prove your innocence, the bond returns to [Water](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80d7b371d75b75b3ac1e).

</aside>

##### Activating Bonds

When making an [aspect art](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e803d8566fb10e0b5130c#1b8b0b885c0e8080b28fc4202b7263fd) roll, you may choose to activate a bond with a matching aura to add dice to it. Activating a matching bond represents tapping into its emotional energy‚Äîits aura‚Äîand grants a number of dice equal to the bond‚Äôs strength.

When activating a bond, you must describe its narrative relevance to the situation.

You start with **3 bond activations**, meaning you can only activate a bond three times until [resting](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e803d8566fb10e0b5130c#1b8b0b885c0e80f78124e5e0be0f55bf). Resting for any amount of time restores 1 bond, up to a maximum of 3.

Any bond may be activated any number of times.

<aside>

Example: you have a [Wind](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80db8f1bcbee1368dc31)-based bond of strength 4 with a loved one, with whom you frequently travel and explore.

You witness said loved one slip and start to fall from a high-up mountainside.

Your desperation to save them allows you to activate the bond, gaining 4 additional dice on a [Wind](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80db8f1bcbee1368dc31) aspect roll to break their fall.

</aside>

### Expenses

[Items](https://www.notion.so/1b8b0b885c0e801ba751e644e7841a85) belong to one of many **expense tiers**, which determine how much is needed to purchase and trade them in the world.

| Name           | Examples                                                             |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Dirt        | Water and other freely-available resources                           |
| 4. Steep       | Premium tools and weapons, extravagant clothing, comfortable lodging |
| 2. Cheap       | Common meals, simple clothing                                        |
| 5. Expensive   | A house, luxurious lodging                                           |
| 6. Valuable    | A mansion                                                            |
| 7. Priceless   | An extremely rare, precious, powerful artifact                       |
| 3. Inexpensive | Five-star meals, basic tools and weapons, reasonable lodging         |

Your **budget** is the expense tier representing the most expensive item you can buy.

Depending on the item‚Äôs tier, purchasing the item may move you to a lower tier.

- Buying an item in **your current tier** will **move you 2 tiers down**.

- Buying an item **1 tier down** will **move you to that tier**.

- You can freely buy items **2 tiers down or lower**.

- **You cannot move lower than the lowest tier**.

If your budget is tier 2:

- Purchasing a tier 2 item moves you to tier 1

- Items in tier 1 are free, and will not move you down when obtained.

When trading or selling items:

- You may trade that item for other items in the same tier

- You may sell that item to move yourself up into that item‚Äôs tier

You may increase your tier by acquiring wealth that would allow purchase within a higher tier, up to the narrator‚Äôs jurisdiction.

Losing wealth in narrative, such as being stolen from, should be treated the same as purchasing. If you have a tier 4 budget, and you have money stolen from you of tier 4 value, you would move down to tier 2.

<aside>

‚ÑπÔ∏è **Example**

As a well-paid shop owner at [5. Expensive](https://www.notion.so/1f2b0b885c0e804dbb55eb431be39838):

- you can afford anything at [3. Inexpensive](https://www.notion.so/1f2b0b885c0e80749885ca27995fc5b1) or lower without a cost

- buying an item at [5. Expensive](https://www.notion.so/1f2b0b885c0e804dbb55eb431be39838) would move you to [3. Inexpensive](https://www.notion.so/1f2b0b885c0e80749885ca27995fc5b1)

- buying an item at [4. Steep](https://www.notion.so/1f2b0b885c0e800f8e30c715a4a4faac) would move you to [4. Steep](https://www.notion.so/1f2b0b885c0e800f8e30c715a4a4faac)

As a thief with no wealth at [1. Dirt](https://www.notion.so/1f2b0b885c0e800eaa52cd26306b2746), stealing just enough to buy a common meal would put you at [2. Cheap](https://www.notion.so/1f2b0b885c0e8011aaa3d04adc9bed6a). Stealing a pouch of quartz from an aristocrat with significant wealth might put you up to [4. Steep](https://www.notion.so/1f2b0b885c0e800f8e30c715a4a4faac).

You can‚Äôt trade an expensive artifact item with a [7. Priceless](https://www.notion.so/1f2b0b885c0e80738fc2e323d93592b2) tier with a common meal at [2. Cheap](https://www.notion.so/1f2b0b885c0e8011aaa3d04adc9bed6a). That‚Äôd be way too many burgers! However, you can try to find a buyer of the artifact‚Äîprobably wouldn‚Äôt be too difficult‚Äîto put yourself into a high enough tier that you‚Äôd buy whatever meals you want afterward.

</aside>

<aside>

üìù **Note:** While there‚Äôs no hard limit to the _number_ of things players can buy for free (at two tiers down or lower), the narrator should place logical limits depending on the scenario.

A player could _theoretically_ try to buy 100 daggers at tier 5, but the shop might only have 3 on sale, so that would be their limit in this case.

</aside>

### Combat

Combat in **Aspects of Nature** isn‚Äôt handled in any special way. However, as an optional rule to make things fair and reduce confusion, you may want to establish a fixed turn order:

- The character who instigated the conflict is the one who goes first

- Next, the person who was impacted

Then, order follows on a logical basis, depending on factors such as:

- Distance to the source of conflict (those closer would go sooner)

- A character‚Äôs speed or reaction time, represented by their [Dexterity](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80039d7fe6cdf5acf995) (those with a higher score would go sooner)

For a more concretely determined order, you may also make competing [Dexterity](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80039d7fe6cdf5acf995) rolls, where those with more successes go before those with less.

Optionally, you can have **teams** of characters‚Äîthose who are narratively allied and working towards or against the same goal‚Äîtake their turns one after another, where initiative is counted on a per-team basis by adding the success count for everyone‚Äôs [Dexterity](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80039d7fe6cdf5acf995) rolls. Your party would take their turns in any order, your adversaries would do the same, as well as any third-party groups that are neutral or enemies to either groups.

You have one action during your turn. If you make a reaction (such as using [Dodge](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80b0bb34ee96169251be)), you forfeit your action for your following turn.

Once per turn, you may use **adrenaline**, which allows you to take 2 fatigue for an additional action.

Using a [consumable item](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e803d8566fb10e0b5130c#1c8b0b885c0e80ad878adbfcdac08b20) does _not_ use an action, but you may only use one item per turn.

Wearing or holding [equipment](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e803d8566fb10e0b5130c#1c8b0b885c0e809281b9c25d3608bd5f) does _not_ use an action, but you may only switch your equipped or wielded item once per turn.

### Lineage

Your lineage determines many of your character‚Äôs physical characteristics and traits. Each lineage represents a broad umbrella of member species within, and comes with a unique special ability.

_Click each entry below for more details!_

| Lineage     | Ability                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Member Creatures                                             |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Umbral      | **Push the Odds** - Once before making an action roll, you may take 1 fatigue to roll with **exploding** dice: when a die lands on 3, roll another die and add it to the result. Repeat for each new 3 that is rolled.                                                                      | _demons, succubus/incubus, vampires_                         |
| Arthropod   | **Double-Edged Senses** - Once per roll, you may add 3 dice to any [Sense](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80ab9d0cfad4b7eb2f10) action roll.

| **Push the Odds** - Once before making an action roll, you may take 1 fatigue to roll with **exploding** dice: when a die lands on 3, roll another die and add it to the result. Repeat for each new 3 that is rolled.                                                                      | _demons, succubus/incubus, vampires_                         | Umbral      |

##### Define your [bonds](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e803d8566fb10e0b5130c#1bdb0b885c0e80a88e37d34e61d7f01f).

When defining the initial bonds for your character, **the strength of them should add to 7**. You could define two bonds strengths of 2 and 5, or three bonds with strengths of 1, 4, and 2, and so on.

Each one should list the following:

- The name of the other character (you can define this later)

- Their relationship to you

- The strength and aura of the bond

- Optionally, any additional details for this bond

To help define your bonds, as well as add depth and intrigue, consider these questions:

- How long has this relationship existed?

- What significant event has most defined this relationship?

- What unspoken expectation does each have of the other?

- What secret might affect this relationship if revealed?

- What underlying tension exists between them?

The **aura** of a bond represents the nature of the bond, corresponding with [aspect auras](https://www.notion.so/1b8b0b885c0e80809c18c6e0ccc7ab05#1beb0b885c0e8082aa4cf4202c8b19ac):

[Fire](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e8067a288dfe795fb6849) indicates an adversarial, heated, conflict-heavy relationship.

[Water](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80d7b371d75b75b3ac1e) comes from notions of comfort, peace, and protection.

[Wind](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80db8f1bcbee1368dc31) exhibits in turbulent relationships full of excitement and change.

[Light](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e808c85f5e09905d8a87e) represents diplomatic relationships built on fairness and respect.

[Darkness](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e8011bb89e175042f5180) manifests from tension, mistrust, and uncertainty.

###### Example

```markdown
## Bonds

Village Elder, Light, 2 - The leader of my hometown who taught me everything I know about combat.
Kendall "Ken", Water, 4 - My beloved brother whom I would defend to the ends of the Earth.
Violetta "Vi", Fire, 1 - A woman I caught and fought with in the midst of a crime. After learning about her connection to a larger organization, I must track her down.

###### Bond Generator

Fleshing out a character‚Äôs background from a blank slate can be difficult. Use this roll table to generate them randomly.

Define a bond by rolling once per column: once for the relationship, once for the strength, and once for the Aura, rerolling if necessary.

After determining the bond, optionally name the other person of the bond and add additional details about the relationship.

Your character‚Äôs skillset is informed by the **skill points** assigned to each **skill**. When making an action roll, certain skills may give bonuses to the roll when relevant. For example: when making an action roll to break a window, the [Strike](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80a5896febd5968d4381) skill would be applicable.

Players start with 5 skill points, and skills may only have up to 5 points assigned to them. You may reassign any number of skill points at the start or end of sessions.

##### Choose your starting [items](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e803d8566fb10e0b5130c#1b8b0b885c0e801ba751e644e7841a85).

First, calculate and write down your carrying capacity, which is equal to:

4 + your [Strength](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80028c4cd651eb7aceee) score + your [skill points](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80d5bb9ce5178ed7b7f4#1c8b0b885c0e8015812fda2be0aa71ba) in [Endure](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80d68ac8e515eec2363b)

Then choose your starting items, which can be:

- up to 2 tools

- up to 1 wearable

- up to 3 consumables

Starting items must fit within your carrying capacity. Consult the narrator for custom items.

###### Example

Using our [previously chosen scores](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e803d8566fb10e0b5130c#1b6b0b885c0e80e9a0ddd966003466a8) and [skill points](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e803d8566fb10e0b5130c#1bbb0b885c0e8056a32bc51fb8a175ef), our capacity would be:

4 + 3 (Strength) + 0 (Endure) = 7

```markdown
## Items (Capacity 7)

- Dagger (Tool, Size 3)
- Crossbow (Tool, Size 3)
- Healing Elixir (Consumable, Size 1)
```

</aside>

##### Finishing touches

- Give your character a [name](https://www.notion.so/1bab0b885c0e802f93a5e0db3eb54bad)!

- Define their [expense tier](https://www.notion.so/1c8b0b885c0e80c680d1d4411eef8ede), as decided by the narrator ([4. Steep](https://www.notion.so/1f2b0b885c0e800f8e30c715a4a4faac) by default).

- Add backstory, personality, relationships, likes and dislikes, etc. under the **Background** section, with as little or as much detail as you prefer

Once you‚Äôve done everything else, calculate your limits:

- Set your damage limit: [Strength](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80028c4cd651eb7aceee) + [Dexterity](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80039d7fe6cdf5acf995)

- Set your fatigue limit: [Sense](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e80ab9d0cfad4b7eb2f10) + [Intellect](https://www.notion.so/1b2b0b885c0e8097891bc55d3cadb9dd) + [Presence](https://www.notion.so/1b1b0b885c0e809fa7a7fc0a4a9d0ede)

And you‚Äôre done!

### üöß Non-Player Characters

Non-player characters (or NPCs) are created and played by the narrator to make the world feel more alive with additional actors.

<aside>

üöß TODO: figure this out, but the goal is to have some System‚Ñ¢Ô∏è during gameplay that can answer the question: ‚Äúhow many dice should I roll for this NPC using this skill right now?‚Äù

</aside>

An NPCs resources and rolls are determined by their **level**, a number starting at 1 with no maximum. As a guideline, a level 1 character would be a very weak, everyday NPC. A level 5 character would be a formidable opponent. A level 10 character would be able to take on several characters at once.

The NPC level scales various values as follows:

| Value                 | Formula                                | Purpose                                                         |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Primary Resource      | [Level] \* 3                           | Apply to hits or max hits                                       |
| Secondary Resource    | [Level] \* 2                           | Apply to hits or max hits                                       |
| Primary Score         | [Level] (min. 3)                       | Apply to strongest attribute and strongest aspect               |
| Secondary Score       | [Level] / 2 (rounded up, min. 2)       | Apply to second strongest attribute and second strongest aspect |
| Baseline Score        | [Level] / 3 (rounded up, min. 1)       | Apply to all other attribute and aspect scores                  |
| Primary Skill Bonus   | [Level] \* 0.75 (rounded down, min. 1) | Apply to their primary skill                                    |
| Secondary Skill Bonus | [Level] \* 0.25 (rounded up)           | Apply to their primary skill                                    |

These values are only a guide; you may deviate from this guide and choose **any** value for NPC scores and bonuses as appropriate.

Additionally, narrators may determine the impact of an NPC action narratively and use a constant number, rather than relying solely on dice. For example, a master assassin should feel deadly, and if the dice don't support that narrative, the story should take precedence.

### Milestones

**Milestones** are events where you and your group reach a major stepping stone in the story. After a milestone, you may upgrade your character in one of a few ways:

- Gain 3 skill points

- Increase damage limit or fatigue limit by 5 (up to 3 times)

When choosing an upgrade, add a new ‚ÄúMilestones‚Äù section on your character sheet if you don‚Äôt have one. Then add a note for the milestone that was achieved and the corresponding upgrade.

<aside>

###### Example

```markdown
# Milestones

- +3 skill points - Found the required artifact to locate the Evilest Villain
- +5 damage limit - Thwarted the Evilest Villan's plans
```

</aside>

After you‚Äôve done that, apply the corresponding update. For example, if you chose to gain skill points, update your ‚ÄúSkill Points‚Äù section to the correct number of points you should have, then specify new or skills to receive points.

## World Lore

### Eisenkind

Eisenwald is populated by human-like people, or **Eisenkind**, with features of animals, such as dogs, cats, foxes, and birds, as well as other fantasy races like dragons and demons. Eisenkind exist alongside animals of their lineages, as well as a breadth of other fanatical creatures and mixes thereof.

#### Names

Eisenkind receive elaborate single names at birth, most of which can be categorized in a few ways:

1. **Fantasy**: These names have an otherworldly sound and feel to them, inspired by fantasy and mythology.

- Masculine examples: Castiel, Astraeus, Asmodai, Rurik, Fenrir, Lucian

- Feminine examples: Euthalia, Lirael, Lysandra, Sylvia, Elysia, Lilith

- Unisex examples: Aeris, Rowan, Lyric, Talon, Phoenix, Kael

1. **Nature**: These names have roots in the natural world, encompassing flora, fauna, seasons, celestial bodies, and other natural phenomena.

- Masculine examples: Orion, August, Ash, Clay, Hawthorn, Forrest

- Feminine examples: Lily, Summer, Luna, Amber, Aurora, Celeste

- Unisex examples: River, Winter, Jupiter, Hazel, Robin, Storm

1. **Everyday**: These names are drawn from ordinary everyday objects or concepts that hold a special significance to the individual. This can be a favorite instrument, color, garment, a cherished item, or a comforting idea.

- Masculine examples: Jet, Oak, Jasper, Reed, Piano, Chip

- Feminine examples: Scarlet, Viola, Garnet, Pearl, Velvet, Crystal

- Unisex examples: Quill, Sage, Indigo, Echo, Scout, Rogue

Longer names are sometimes accompanied by a shorter nickname used in casual conversation. These names are written as ‚ÄúFullname ‚ÄòNickname‚Äô‚Äù (for example, ‚ÄúLunaria ‚ÄòLuna‚Äô‚Äù or ‚ÄúSaphira ‚ÄòSaph‚Äô‚Äù)

While Eisenkind do not use family names in the traditional sense, relatives often share naming elements or patterns to signify their connection. Siblings might have names beginning with the same prefix or ending with similar sounds. For example, siblings named "Lumina 'Mina'" and "Lunaria 'Luna'" share the "Lu-" prefix, while cousins "Fernspire 'Fern'" and "Stormspire 'Storm'" share the "-spire" suffix.

Welcome to **Aspects of Nature, **a story-focused TTRPG, set in a contemporary setting, interspersed with supernatural elements and pockets of fantasy.

Enter Rosenfeld. The bustling city is one of few cities in Eisenwald with an urban, modern look and feel, despite, by our standards, having medieval-level technology. It manages this having weaved element-based technique and automation through various facets of daily life.

**Fire. Water. Wind. Light. Darkness.** Though the five **aspects** take a backseat to everyday life, they have enabled a breadth of capability, innovation, and exploration otherwise impossible.

**Aspect art** is less like magic in the sense of spells and incantations, and more like a martial art, working primarily through focus, intent, and alignment with the surrounding environment.

Rosenfeld in particular offers a diverse look at the various **lineages** of Eisenkind: the presentation of traits from specific creatures through otherwise human-like figures. You'll find humans with the ears and tails of canines, felines, rabbits, mice, bears, raccoons, and several other common land mammals. You'll find aquatic-based humans with fins, humans with horns and scales like that of dragons and lizards, those with the feathered wings of a bird, with the antennae and wings of insects, or even the horns and spaded tail characteristic of a devil. The several similar but distinct origins of Eisenkind are represented here in Rosenfeld.

Among these variant folk, you'll see some happily chatting with friends through the tall glass windows of a cafe, warmly lit by candle-like light aspect crystals. You'll see students running after one another, recklessly firing blasts of water and wind at one another‚Äîthe first one, a young fin-adorned aquatic, bumps into you, then he and his more timid demonic friend briefly apologize, before continuing with more care. You'll pass by a construction site, with several workers summon gusts of wind to propel themselves high into the frames of buildings to place the next few parts, welding them together with the heat of their fire aspect, while some slow their descent coming back down with practiced ease.

Your ears suddenly flick and stand tall as they pick up a noise from behind, but as you turn to look, no one is there. It sounded like a gasp‚Äîalmost like‚Ä¶ a squelched shout? ‚Ä¶Maybe you're hearing things.
